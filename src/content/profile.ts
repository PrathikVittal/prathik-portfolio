    about: [
        "I’m a software engineer focused on building cloud-native systems, real-time data pipelines, and AI-driven applications that are secure, scalable, and production ready.",
        "Currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton. I bring 2+ years of industry experience designing and delivering distributed backend services, data workflows, and full-stack features across cloud environments. My work spans modern web stacks like React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind, along with cloud platforms and data/ML tooling across Google Cloud and AWS.",
        "I’m particularly interested in distributed systems, cloud architecture, and applied AI, especially how intelligent services integrate into reliable software platforms. My portfolio showcases projects in conversational AI, assistant systems, and secure application design, along with hands-on cloud and machine learning implementations.",
        "Beyond academics and professional work, I actively build technical projects to explore new technologies and architectural patterns. I enjoy experimenting with emerging tools in AI and cloud engineering, and continuously refining how systems are designed, scaled, and shipped.",
